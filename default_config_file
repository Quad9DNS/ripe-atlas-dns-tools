; Config file for ra-dns-check.py
;
; This file is automatically created if it does not exist.  After its
; initial creation, the script will add missing parameters to this config
; file, but otherwise should not overwrite any changes you make!  (If you
; ever want to reset everything to the script defaults, you can rename or
; delete this file and the script will create a new one.)
;
; Some important notes on this file's syntax :
;
; 1) This file is read by the ConfigParser python module, and therefore
;    (perhaps surprisingly) it expects Windoze INI syntax *NOT* python
;    syntax. So:
;    * do NOT enclose strings within quotes or double quotes
;      (they will be passed along with the string and break things)
;    * protect/escape any '%' character with another '%'
;    *  either ':' or '=' can be used to separate a config variable (key) and its value.
;    * spaces are allowed *within* (as part of) a value or key!
;      (So be careful of leading spaces before key names.
;       E.g ' probe_properties_to_report = ...' will break!)
;
; 2) Do not remove or change the [DEFAULT] line, python's ConfigParser module depends upon it.
